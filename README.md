# puzzletrail-wordsearchgame
PuzzleTrail is a Windows application "word search puzzle" game. This project is solo developed by myself until further notice. This project will feature a customisable puzzle generator with custom word-bank for unique puzzles, word-bank editor and a library to display your solved puzzles! With import/export functionalities, it will be easy to share your word banks and puzzles with your friends! The aim of this project is to allow me to do a software development project from A to Z, from the planning phases to the end of the project with the full application, project artifacts and a complete test suite.
